# Autonomous-Golf-Cart-Testbed

In the pursuit of developing the Montclair Autonomous Golf Cart Testbed, a multifaceted project encompassing various subsystems, the primary objectives align with creating an autonomous vehicle. Each module plays a crucial role, contributing to the goal of achieving a seamlessly functioning, self-navigating golf cart. My specific focus has been on the LiDAR subsystem within the Sensory System.
